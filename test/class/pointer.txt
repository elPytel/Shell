Since Bash 4.3, declare has a flag -n to define references (this is loosely equivalent to references in C++). This flag tremendously simplifies your problem here:

fullname() {
    declare -nl pointer="$1"
    for i in "${!pointer[@]}"
    do
        echo "${pointer[$i]} $i"
    done
}
It will be safe if you're having spaces or funny symbols in the keys of your hash (unlike the accepted answer).
